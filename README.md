# AJBell-HackJR23
AJ Bell Challenge description for Hack Manchester Junior

AJ Bell is on a mission to empower young people to take control of their financial futures. We believe that starting to save early is crucial for financial well-being. In this hackathon challenge, we invite participants aged 11-18 to create innovative solutions that inspire and enable young individuals to save for their future. Whether it's for education, a dream home, or retirement, the goal is to make saving exciting and accessible.

Potential Ideas and Inspirations:

1. **Interactive Savings App**:
Develop a mobile app that makes saving fun and engaging for young users. The app could incorporate gamification elements, allowing users to set savings goals, track progress, and earn rewards for reaching milestones.

2. **Financial Education Game**:
Create an interactive game or simulation that educates players about the importance of saving and investing. Players could navigate real-life financial scenarios and learn how different choices impact their future finances.

3. **AI Financial Assistant**:
Build a chatbot or AI-powered assistant that provides personalized savings advice. It could offer savings tips, suggest investment options, and help users create a customized savings plan.

4. **Peer-to-Peer Saving**:
Design a platform that encourages friends and family to save together. Users can set group savings goals, contribute, and support each other's financial aspirations.

5. **Savings Challenge Social Network**:
Create a social network or platform where young savers can join challenges, share their progress, and connect with like-minded peers. Encourage a sense of community around savings.

6. **Financial Literacy Content Hub**:
Build a website or platform that offers a wealth of easy-to-understand financial literacy content. Include articles, videos, and interactive tools to teach users about saving, investing, and financial planning.

7. **Pocket Money Investment App**:
Develop an app that helps children and teens invest their pocket money wisely. It could offer a simplified investment portfolio and educational resources.

8. **School Savings Program**:
Propose a program that partners with schools to teach financial literacy and encourage students to save. Students could have access to special savings accounts or incentives for saving part of their allowances.

9. **Augmented Reality Piggy Bank**:
Create an AR app that brings a digital piggy bank to life. Users can 'feed' it with their spare change and watch their savings grow in an interactive and educational way.

Teams should consider the accessibility, user-friendliness, and impact of their solutions on the target age group. The goal is to make saving a habit, demystify finances, and set young individuals on a path toward a financially secure future. AJ Bell is excited to see your creative ideas in action!
